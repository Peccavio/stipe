#Stipe Compass Extension
Stipe is the life blood of the Toadstool style guide framework. Consisting of a series of mixins, extends and defaults that give Toadstool that 'instant on' experience. 

[Stipe](https://rubygems.org/gems/stipe)

##To install
`gem install stipe`

##To use 
To use the Stipe gem, using Bundler `gem 'stipe'`

Stipe is a Compass Extension, so Compass is set as a depdency. You will need to include `require 'stipe'` in your config.rb file.

##Sass / Compass
**(BLEEDING EDGE ALERT)** Toadstool is using ``3.2.0.alpha.*``
For [reasons explained](/Anotheruiguy/toadstool/blob/master/doc-src/exploited-bug.md) please continue using the alpha gem and upgrading to Sass 3.2 will break Toadstool and Stipe.
